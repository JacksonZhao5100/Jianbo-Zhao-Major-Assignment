The apples on the tree and the suns on sky will autometically floating, the background will changed with the time.

The method I chose is Perlin Noise, which can create the dynamic animate to the apple tree that we did, which show the apple will general swing on the tree.
I also add 10 circles that refers to 10 suns, which make my project different from other group members.
The inspiration is from the religion and myth aspect. Because Anwar was inspired from the myth in bible, I am tring to mix some chinese myth to the original art work. Considered the time of the forbidden fruit was in acient world, I have add 10 suns in the art, which inspired from the chinese myth called Hou Yi shoots the sun. This myth telled there were ten suns on the sky in acient, and Hou Yi shot down 9 of them to reduce the heat in the world.
